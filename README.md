## What is this application about?

Healthcare is crucial to everyone and this application aims to help users locate the nearest hospital, dialysis clinc or COVID lab from their current location. The current application is built primarily using react and the google maps API and targets users in the Philippines which may not have easy access to the healthcare facilities.

Part of a broader application that I built during my time interning at Botmd, a Y-Combinator startup that builts chatbots for hospitals in over 4 countries!

## Key Challenges

This is my very first experience with React and I am glad that I have started to learn how to use this amazing tool! Picking up a new language is always tough and I am glad that I have something cool to show for it!
